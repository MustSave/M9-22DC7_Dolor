Load "Tractor_Beam_FX.unity" for an example scene, or simply drag the Tractor Beam effect from the Prefab folder (in the Project window) into the Hierarchy window.

There's several parameters available for tractor beam; select the tractor beam in the hierarchy window and these will be available to you in the Inspector window (on the right): Selecting (ticking the box) for Mouse Look will use the mouse to control the direction of the tractor beam. Beam Angle controls the cone angle of the tractor beam lines. Selecting (ticking the box) for Track Target will rotate the tractor beam to always face any GameObject in the Beam Target slot (the option in the line below). Rotation Speed will be the speed that the tractor beam rotates to face this target. Beam Power is the speed at which the tractor beam pulls object in.

Note that for the tractor beam to pull in a GameObject the target will need to have collision and also be a Rigidbody. The Orion_Capsule Prefab is included as an example.

Have fun!
